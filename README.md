# 🐍 Python Fundamentals & Projects

# Python Learning Journey
## Project Overview
This repository serves as my personal record and resource hub while learning the Python programming language. It contains organized notes, basic exercises, and small projects demonstrating mastery of core concepts. 

I started this journey by focusing on data structures and foundational elements. The code here is a mix of simple scripts (.py files) and detailed notes.

## 📚 Topics Covered So Far

I have successfully completed and documented the following foundational Python topics:

* **Primitive Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `NoneType`.
* **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections, including slicing, comprehension, and methods like `append()`, `extend()`, and `sort()`.
* **Strings:** Immutability, formatting (f-strings), and common string operations (`split`, `join`, `strip`).
* **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections, often used for data integrity or key generation.
* **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements, perfect for checking membership and performing mathematical set operations (union, intersection).
* **Dictionaries (Dicts):** Key-value mappings, covering access, modification, and common dictionary methods.
* **Control Flow:** Mastering `if/elif/else` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops for execution control.
* **Functions:** Defining functions, understanding scope and keyword arguments functions.

### 📊 Data Science Libraries
I have also integrated the core libraries used for data analysis and visualization:
* **NumPy:** High-performance multidimensional array processing and mathematical functions.
* **Pandas:** Powerful data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames and Series.
* **Matplotlib:** Foundational library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** Statistical data visualization for building attractive and informative graphics.


## 📊 Statistics & Data Analysis
I have developed a solid foundation in statistical analysis, enabling me to derive insights from complex datasets. My expertise includes:

### 🔍 Descriptive Statistics
* **Central Tendency:** Proficient in calculating and interpreting Mean, Median, and Mode.
* **Dispersion:** Analysis of Variance and Standard Deviation to understand data spread.

### 🧪 Inferential Statistics
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Designing and executing tests to validate assumptions.
* **Significance:** Interpreting P-values and constructing Confidence Intervals to ensure results are statistically significant.

### 📈 Probability Distributions
* Understanding and applying **Normal (Gaussian)**, **Binomial**, and **Poisson** distributions to model real-world data behavior.



### 📉 Regression Analysis
* **Linear Regression:** Modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables.
* **Multiple Regression:** Handling multiple predictors to forecast outcomes and identify trends.


## 🎯 Next Steps & Future Focus

The learning path continues with these planned topics:
* **Basic I/O:** Reading and writing files (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`).
* **Error Handling:** Using `try`, `except`, `finally` for robust code.
