# 🐍 Python Fundamentals & Projects

# Python Learning Journey
## Project Overview
This repository serves as my personal record and resource hub while learning the Python programming language. It contains organized notes, basic exercises, and small projects demonstrating mastery of core concepts. 

I started this journey by focusing on data structures and foundational elements. The code here is a mix of simple scripts (.py files) and detailed notes.

## 📚 Topics Covered So Far

I have successfully completed and documented the following foundational Python topics:

* **Primitive Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `NoneType`.
* **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections, including slicing, comprehension, and methods like `append()`, `extend()`, and `sort()`.
* **Strings:** Immutability, formatting (f-strings), and common string operations (`split`, `join`, `strip`).
* **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections, often used for data integrity or key generation.
* **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements, perfect for checking membership and performing mathematical set operations (union, intersection).
* **Dictionaries (Dicts):** Key-value mappings, covering access, modification, and common dictionary methods.

### 📊 Data Science Libraries
I have also integrated the core libraries used for data analysis and visualization:
* **NumPy:** High-performance multidimensional array processing and mathematical functions.
* **Pandas:** Powerful data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames and Series.
* **Matplotlib:** Foundational library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** Statistical data visualization for building attractive and informative graphics.

## 🎯 Next Steps & Future Focus

The learning path continues with these planned topics:

* **Control Flow:** Mastering `if/elif/else` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops for execution control.
* **Functions:** Defining functions, understanding scope, keyword arguments, and lambda functions.
* **Basic I/O:** Reading and writing files (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`).
* **Error Handling:** Using `try`, `except`, `finally` for robust code.
